    "# Question (1):- What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer (1):- A tuple is a sequence of values separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses. Tuples are similar to lists in many ways, but they are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the characteristics of tuples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are ordered: The order of elements in a tuple is preserved and can be accessed using indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples allow duplicates: A tuple can contain duplicate elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples can contain elements of different data types: A tuple can contain elements of any data type, including other tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are immutable: Once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. However, you can create a new tuple by concatenating two or more tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are more memory-efficient than lists: Because tuples are immutable, they take up less memory than lists, which can be useful when working with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, ordered, allow duplicates and can contain elements of different data types.\n"

    "# Question (2):- What are the two tuple methods in python? Give an example of each method. Give a reason why\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer (2):- tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to Lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two tuple methods in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "count(): This method returns the number of times a specified element appears in a tuple.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "scss\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2)\n",
    "count = t.count(2)\n",
    "print(count)  # Output: 3\n",
    "index(): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in a tuple.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "perl\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2)\n",
    "index = t.index(3)\n",
    "print(index)  # Output: 2\n",
    "The reason why tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to lists is that tuples are immutable, which means that their contents cannot be changed once they are created. As a result, many of the methods that are available for lists, such as append(), extend(), insert(), and remove(), which modify the list in place, do not make sense for tuples. The two tuple methods, count() and index(), are designed to work with the contents of the tuple without modifying it, which is why they are sufficient for most use cases involving tuples."
